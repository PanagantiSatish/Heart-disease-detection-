# Heart-disease-detection-
This repo is for diagnosing heart disease by using Particle Swarms optimization algorithm for feature selection and random forest for detection 



first run the preprocessed python file to preprocessing the datasets
then run normalize.py to do normalization
then feature selection by PSO in swarms.py
then random forest for detection
